                <h3>Overview</h3>
               <p>Rwanda understands the importance of infrastructure in the development of a competitive private sector. To this end, the government continues to invest heavily in infrastructure. Almost a tenth of Rwanda’s annual budget is committed to transport and other infrastructure. To develop a vibrant private sector, Rwanda is investing in Roads, Rail, and water transport infrastructure with the intent of dramatically reducing the cost of transport to businesses and individuals.</p>
